7.3. Mandatory Binding Arbitration.
By agreeing to these Terms of Use, Licensee agrees that any Dispute shall be finally settled by binding individual arbitration in accordance with the rules and procedures of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in San Francisco, California, USA, and not in a court of law in any jurisdiction, and not in a class, representative, or consolidated action or proceeding, as further set forth below.  Licensee and StreamNative agree that one (1) arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any Disputes relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable.  The arbitrator shall also be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement are unconscionable or illusory and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, or estoppel.  Judgment of the award rendered by the arbitrator may be confirmed, reduced to judgment, and entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

7.4. Class Action Waiver.
Licensee acknowledges and agrees that Licensee and StreamNative are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding.  Unless both Licensee and StreamNative agree in writing, any arbitration will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, collective, consolidated, or representative proceeding.  If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this Section is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the entirety of the Arbitration Agreement set forth in this Section will be deemed null and void and Licensee and StreamNative will be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate Disputes on an individual basis.  Notwithstanding Licensee’s and StreamNative’s agreement to resolve all Disputes through arbitration, Licensee and StreamNative each retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights.

7.5. Rules, Procedures, and Governing Law.
The arbitration will be administered by the AAA under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and any supplementary rules then in effect (the “AAA Rules”), except as modified by the terms and conditions of this Agreement.  The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.  The rules of the arbitral forum will govern all aspects of this arbitration, except to the extent those rules conflict with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.  Notwithstanding any choice of law or other provision in this Agreement, Licensee and StreamNative agree and acknowledge that this Arbitration Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (“FAA”) will govern its interpretation and enforcement and proceedings pursuant thereto.  It is the intent of Licensee and StreamNative that the FAA and AAA Rules shall preempt all state laws to the fullest extent permitted by law.  If the FAA and AAA Rules are found to not apply to any issue that arises under this Arbitration Agreement or the enforcement thereof, that issue will be resolved under the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.  A party who desires to initiate an arbitration must submit a written Demand for Arbitration to the AAA and give notice to the other party as specified in the AAA Rules.  The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at www.adr.org.  You can contact AAA for more information on how to commence an arbitration proceeding at www.adr.org or 1-800-778-7879.
